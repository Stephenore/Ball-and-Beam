# Ball and Beam Control System Project

This project simulates a classic non-linear control system, where the goal is to balance a ball on a beam using a PID controller.

## Project Files
- `Project_1.m`: MATLAB code for system simulation.
- `lab_ex3.slx`: Simulink model of the system.
- `BB_SYSTEM_PROJECT_SIM.slx`: Final Simulink model with full system implementation.
- `FirstYearProject.docx`: Project documentation, including system design, theory, and testing.

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB and run the `.m` files.
2. Open Simulink and load the `.slx` files for simulation.
